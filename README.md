# Run command
Please use the `Main_AutoPanoStitch.m` to run the program. Change the `folderPath      = '../../../Data/Generic';` to your desired folder path. Also, change the `folderName      = '';` to a valid name. You can download the whole Generic folder datasets in [AutoPanoStitch Stitching Datasets Compilation](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AlFYM4jwmzqrtaBpxVMpJegvN9QVZw?e=UIaYug).

Change the hyper parameters accordingly if needed. But it is not required though.

# Note
Depending on how your images are captured, panaroma being a `spherical`, `cylindrical` or `planar` should be selected judicially using the `input.warpType` and `input.Transformationtype`. Generally, `spherical` or `cylindrical` projections with `affine` or `rigid` transformation should work well in most of the cases. However, some panoramas specifically looks good in `projective` transformation, e.g. flatbed scanner or whiteboard (`affine` works well too) images.

Currently, spherical, cyclindrical and planar projections stitching is supported in this version and can recognize multiple panoramas. This work is in progress, further improvements such as the inclusion of a full view `360 x 180-degree` panoramas stitching (everything visible from a point), automatic panorama straightening, runtime speed optimization and Graphical User Interface (GUI) are under development. Your patience will be appreciated.

# Image stitching/panorama datasets
Creating image stitching datasets takes a lot of time and effort. During my Ph.D. days, I tried to compile datasets that were comprehensive to have `spherical`, `cylindrical` or `planar` and full view `360 x 180-degree` panoramas. These datasets posed a real challenge to the automatic stitching method. If all these datasets are stitched well, it definitely shows the robustness of your stitching method.

All these datasets are public! Some of them were from my Ph.D. studies (especially on cracks) and most of them were downloaded from the internet. I do not remember the individual names of the dataset providers. But I acknowledge their work and I am thankful to all of them! I hope you appreciate their efforts in making these datasets public to advance the research!

Below are some samples from the datasets. There are 100+ `panorama` or `image stitching/registration` datasets in total. You can download them in [AutoPanoStitch Stitching Datasets Compilation](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AlFYM4jwmzqrtaBpxVMpJegvN9QVZw?e=UIaYug). Please note that this dataset compilation is more for the qualitative analysis of the image stitching problem. For quantitative analaysis, I recommend using [Quantitative Image Stitching Datasets](https://github.com/visionxiang/Image-Stitching-Dataset). If I come across any interesting and challenging datasets, I will expand this compilation.

# Known issues
1. Bundle adjustment using the `lsqnonlin` in MATLAB is computationally slow.
2. Panoramic images needs to be straightened, some of the panoramas will be skewed.

# Adaptation of open source 
Bundle adjustment functions in MATLAB are adapted from the [Kevin Luo's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kluo8128/cs231_project) and heavily improved.

# Licensing conditions
The original implementation of the automatic panaroma stitching by Dr. Brown was written in C++ and is `LICENSED under The University of British Columbia`. This is being programmed and made available to public for academic / research purposes only. Please cite the relevant citations as provided in the main file.
